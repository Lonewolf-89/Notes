# `Networking Notes`

## What is Networking ?

>Networks are simply things connected. In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. 

## What is Internet ? 
> The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself.

>There are 2 types of Networks:
1. Private Network  
2. Public Network

>As previously stated, the Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together.  These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks.

>Public IP addresses are given by your Internet Service Provider (or ISP) at a monthly fee (your bill!)

## What is IP Address?
>An IP address is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the network.

>Older one is an IPv4 addressing scheme, which uses a numbering system of 2^32 IP adresses (4.29 billion)

>IPv6 is a new iteration of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme to help tackle the issue of shortage of IPv4 addresses.

>Supports up to 2^128 of IP addresses (340 trillion-plus), resolving the issues faced with IPv4

## What is MAC Address ?
>Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a ***MAC (Media Access Control)*** address.

>The MAC address is a **twelve-character hexadecimal number** (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators.
